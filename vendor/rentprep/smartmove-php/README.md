# SmartMove PHP Library

## Requirements

PHP 5.3.3 and later.

## Composer

You can install the library via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```bash
composer require rentprep/smartmove-php
```

To use the library, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Manual Installation

If you do not wish to use Composer, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/rentprep/smartmove-php/releases). Then, to use the library, include the `init.php` file.

```php
require_once('/path/to/smartmove-php/init.php');
```

## Getting Started

Simple usage looks like:

```php
use SmartMove\SmartMove;

SmartMove::setApiKey('XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX');
SmartMove::setSandboxMode(true); //change to false for production

$referenceId = 'XXX'; // The unique ID in your system of the person who created the application
$applications = SmartMove::getApplications($referenceId);
```

Optionally, your application's user `$referenceId` can be set once, globally.

```php
use SmartMove\SmartMove;

SmartMove::setApiKey('XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX');
SmartMove::setSandboxMode(true); //change to false for production
SmartMove::setReferenceId('XXX');

$applications = SmartMove::getApplications();
```
